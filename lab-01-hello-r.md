```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

This data set has 1846 rows and 3 columns. The variables are 1) the data
set, 2) the x values, and 3) the y values.

### Exercise 2

The answers for this Exercise are given for you below. But you should
clean up some of the narrative so that it only includes what you want to
turn in.

First let’s plot the data in the dino dataset:

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

The correlation between x and y is -.0645

### Exercise 3

``` r
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-star-1.png)<!-- -->

The star data set forms a star shape. So a correlation doesn’t make much
more sense, but as you can see below the correlation is -.0630.

``` r
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0630

### Exercise 4

Below is the plotted circle data and correlation. Again, a correlation
doesn’t make much sense given the shape of the data, but it’s -.0683.

``` r
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-circle-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0683

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed. To add R chunks either type out the
backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk
button above, green C+.
